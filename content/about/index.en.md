I'm, Valentin Tolmer, a software craftsman always in search of quality in the
products I build. I'm the creator and maintainer of
[LLDAP](https://github.com/lldap/lldap), a super-simple and lightweight LDAP
server for self-hosting.

I'm also a fan of teaching, and in this blog I explain some technical concepts
in simple words.

If you like what I'm doing, feel free to [buy me a
cup of tea](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/nitnelave).
