*What is the best programming language? Why is Vim better than Emacs? Tabs or
spaces? Static or dynamic typing? The answer to all these questions and more on
"Confused bit".*

This blog is a place to host and share my thoughts on software, crafting, and
my experience with various projects. It may or may not be entirely devoid of
non irrelevant content for the wrong audience. Confused? So am I. Welcome to a
world where we don't know what we're doing, and we just hope our code doesn't
crash in prod.

Some of the things that I might talk about on this blog:
 - I am, or I aspire to be, a careful coder (as opposed to ["move fast and
   break things"](https://xkcd.com/1428/)). But I also know that to err is to
   be human, so I try to get the compiler to tell me when I'm doing something
   wrong (so yes, I prefer static to dynamic typing).
 - I will probably talk about my side project
   [LLDAP](https://github.com/nitnelave/lldap) at some point, since it's the
   bulk of my open source activity these days.
 - But also I'll try to share interesting things that I come across, and my
   thoughts on them. Hopefully, by being longer form than a comment on
   somebody's website, they will be a bit more rounded than the average
   internet interaction.
